To perform these assignments, refer to the tables in the JustLee Books database.  Generate and test two SQL queries for each of the following tasks:




<ul>

 <li>the SQL statement needed to perform the stated task with the traditional approach,</li>

 <li>the SQL statement needed to perform the stated task with the JOIN keyword.</li>

</ul>




Apply table aliases in all queries.
